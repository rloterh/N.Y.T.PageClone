              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
              and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
              the world of known physics.

              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
              in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
              hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
              that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
              prodigiously violent instant.

              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
              and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
              irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
              ocean.

              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
              Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
              Pole, a team of astronomers led by John
              M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the
              signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of
              a trillionth of a second old. They
              are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr.
              Guth was correct.

              colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
              correct.
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
              whether it could ever be proved.

              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
              of dark energy pushing the
              universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
              science and speculation.

              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
              its hundreds of billions of
              galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
              unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
              own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot
              of pasta water boiling over.

            <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
              reach of particle accelerators
              on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
              observation of gravitational waves,
              which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
              said, “This is huge, as big as it
              gets.”

              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
              gravitational waves.”

              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
              space and preserves a picture
              of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
              Extragalactic Polarization,
              reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set
              of papers submitted to The
              Astrophysical Journal.
